Ideally we would want to have all words related to location removed to allow for a more accuract depiction of the coefficients. Nevertheless, we can argue that this model is usable, on a very basic level but enough to predict and completely understand customer sentiment.\n",

Yes it was able to pick out the odd topic with bi-grams, however it was not 100% optimal for our use case. I am however proud that at the bare minimum our model can definitely detect sentiment on a basic level, which will allow for some automation... "
